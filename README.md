# Number-Guessing-Game-Django

A simple number guessing game made using a python web framework called 'django' that asks the user for a guess, and prints if the guess is correct, smaller or larger. The user can play again which clears the previous guesses list and generates a new number between 0 and 100.

I use models, sessions, templates and class views in django.
